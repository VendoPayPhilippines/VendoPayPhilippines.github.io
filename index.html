                <h2>1. No Collection of Personal Data</h2>
                <p>
                    VendoPay is currently in its prototype stage. We do not collect or process any personal data.
                    All displayed information within the app is hard-coded and is not linked to any backend services.

                <h2>2. Purpose of the App</h2>
                <p>
                    VendoPay is designed for merchants to sell digital products such as e-wallet top-ups, prepaid load,
                    bills payment,
                    and bank deposits. However, this version is non-functional and serves only as a demonstration of the
                    app's interface.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Non-Functionality Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>
                    The VendoPay prototype does not perform any real transactions, connect to backend servers, or
                    process personal data.

                    As the app transitions from prototype to full functionality, we will update this Privacy Policy to
                    reflect any changes
                    in data collection, use, and storage. These updates will ensure compliance with all applicable
